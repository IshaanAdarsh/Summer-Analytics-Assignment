# Summer Analytics Assignment Repository

This repository contains all the hackathon and assignment submissions for the Summer Analytics Course by IIT Guwahati. Throughout the course, I learned various concepts and techniques related to data analysis and machine learning.

### Week 1
I gained a strong foundation in Python programming and its essential libraries, such as NumPy and Pandas. I also learned how to perform data analysis and visualization using these tools.

### Week 2
Focused on machine learning algorithms, including linear regression and logistic regression. I learned about handling missing values, cost functions, and gradient ascent for model optimization.

### Week 3
Model tuning was the key topic in Week 3. I discovered techniques to address overfitting and underfitting, evaluated models using the confusion matrix, and explored various evaluation metrics.

### Week 4
Tree-based algorithms were covered in Week 4, where I learned about tree-based models, gradient boosting, and the importance of feature selection and engineering. Hyperparameter tuning was emphasized for optimal model performance.

### Week 5
In Week 5, I delved into neural networks and deep learning. I gained insights into unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction, and applied K Means clustering to identify patterns in data.

### Week 6-7
#### Capstone Project and Final Hackathon
-   Capstone Project: Predict the Target variable based on anonymized features.
-   Healthy Life Style Hackathon: Predict the target column values using the trained model.

Achievements
------------
- Capstone Project Rank: 65
- Healthy Life Style Hackathon Rank: 24
  - F1 Score: 87.6919
